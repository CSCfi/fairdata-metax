            a suffix in the filter name ('_person' or '_organization'). Actor type '_organization' finds matches
            from "is_member_of" -field if actor is a person. Multiple actor_filters can be applied simultaneously (AND)
            or separately (OR) by using 'condition_separator'. Default separator is AND. If filtered by organizational/person ID,
            search needs to be made using complete IDs. Complete person IDs consist of 19 characters matching the following pattern: 0000-0002-1825-0097.
            Complete organizational IDs consist of at least 5 characters, the 5 first characters always being numbers (e.g. 00170 or 01901-H960).
