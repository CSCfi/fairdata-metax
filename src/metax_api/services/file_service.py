        Mark files as deleted en masse. Parameter file_identifiers can be a list of pk's
        (integers), or file identifiers (strings).

        Currently the assumption is that a bulk delete request will always contain ALL the files
        in a directory, and its sub-directories, so the end result after all the operations should
        be that the top-dir found in a list of files should effectively be completely cut out.

        By far the easiest solution would have been to just find the top file_path, and delete all
        files and dirs within the project scope that begin with said path, but it was recommended
        to operate explicitly on the given file identifiers to minimize the opportunity for any
        unforeseen accidents.

        Since metax has to make due with working only with lists of the files themselves and
        their file paths instead of being given the related directories with their unique
        identifiers as well, this method goes a decent length to protect the file hierarchy from
        ending up in any kind of inconsistent state, mostly culminating in making sure that
        - there will not be any directories or files without parent directories
          (a project can only have one directory without a parent, which is the root
          /project_x_FROZEN directory. This method will delete the root as well, though,
          when approriate).
        - any directory being deleted does not have files in it (directories are deleted
          after deleting the specified files, so any files still found in the directories
          implies there is a de-sync between IDA and metax)
        - there will not be any "orphaned" directory chains (with no files in them) between
          the top and the bottom of the file hierarchy

        Any evidence of the previous scenarios will raise an error.

        The method returns a http response with the number of deleted files in the body.
